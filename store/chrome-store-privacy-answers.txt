CHROME WEB STORE PRIVACY TAB ANSWERS - FRENCH POPUPS
=====================================================

SINGLE PURPOSE
--------------
Single purpose description (1000 chars max):

French Popups is an educational tool designed to help language learners improve their French by providing instant word translations on hover. The extension allows users to globally activate or deactivate the dictionary from the extension popup menu. When activated, it displays a non-intrusive popup with definitions in one of 23 supported target languages. By using offline dictionaries, it provides a fast, privacy-focused experience that allows users to understand French text without leaving their current tab. All features—from the global toggle to the localized translation popups—serve this single mission of facilitating French language acquisition through seamless, in-context reference.


PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION
-------------------------

Storage justification (1000 chars max):

The "storage" permission is used exclusively to save three user preferences locally on the device (via chrome.storage.local):
1. targetLanguage: The preferred target translation language (e.g., English, Spanish).
2. globallyEnabled: A toggle to activate or deactivate the extension's hover functionality globally.
3. showDefinitions: A preference to show or hide detailed word definitions in the popup.
This ensures a consistent user experience across sessions without transmitting any data to external servers. Without this permission, these settings would reset every time the browser is closed.

Host permission justification (1000 chars max):

French Popups requires the "<all_urls>" match pattern for its content scripts so that the dictionary functionality can work automatically on any webpage where a user encounters French text. This "always-on" behavior is essential for a hover-to-translate tool. We have removed the "host_permissions" field and the "activeTab" permission to be as restrictive as possible, requesting access ONLY for the injection of the translation logic script. We do not monitor browsing history, collect user data, or make any external network requests. All dictionary processing is done entirely offline within the content script.



REMOTE CODE
-----------
Are you using remote code? NO

Justification (1000 chars max):

French Popups does NOT use any remote code. All logic and dictionary data are bundled within the extension package. This includes the content scripts (content.js, dict.js), the background worker (background.js), and the comprehensive offline dictionary files (stored in the data/ directory). The extension operates entirely offline once installed; it never fetches scripts from external domains, uses eval(), or makes API calls to third-party translation services. This architecture ensures high performance and absolute user privacy.


DATA USAGE
----------
What user data do you plan to collect from users now or in the future?

☐ Personally identifiable information - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Health information - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Financial and payment information - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Authentication information - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Personal communications - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Location - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Web history - NOT COLLECTED
☐ User activity - NOT COLLECTED
☐ Website content - NOT COLLECTED

Answer: NONE - We do not collect ANY user data. The ONLY data stored are 3 local parameters (targetLanguage, globallyEnabled, showDefinitions) inside the user's browser via chrome.storage.local. No data is transmitted to external servers, no analytics are performed, and no user tracking is implemented.


CERTIFICATIONS
--------------
☑ I certify that I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases
☑ I certify that I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose
☑ I certify that I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes

Answer: ALL THREE CERTIFICATIONS ARE TRUE. The extension is dedicated solely to language learning and does not collect or transmit any data whatsoever.
